# Cinema visit

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

You have opened your own cinema. To have a better idea  
of what's going on in the cinema 
you decided to keep a record of events in the cinema.
For this purpose you have to create such modules:

1. In directory `app` create package `cinema`. In this
package create modules:  
   - `bar.py` - inside this module create `CinemaBar`
   class that describes work of cinema bar.
   This class should have only one static method `sell_product`,
   that takes `product` - name of the product that customer wants
   and `customer` - `Customer` instance, that means customer.
   The `sell_product` method sells a product to the customer and displays which product was sold and to whom.

   а
```python
   cb = CinemaBar()
   customer = Customer("Bob", "popcorn")
   cb.sell_product(customer=customer, product=customer.food)
   # Cinema bar sold popcorn to Bob.
   ```

   -`hall.py` - inside this module create `CinemaHall`
   class that describes actions during the movie session. Its
   `__init__` method takes and stores ONLY the `number `of the hall in the cinema.
   This class should have only one method `movie_session`, that
   takes `movie_name`, `customers` - list of a customers
   (`Customer` instances), `cleaning_staff` - cleaner (`Cleaner` 
   instance). This method prints about movie start, calls 
   customers method `watch_movie`, prints about movie end,
   calls cleaner method `clean_hall`. So, we are expecting
   that everything listed above will be performed in `movie_session` function.

```python
hall = CinemaHall(hall_number=5)
movie_name = "Madagascar"
customers = [
    Customer(name="Bob", food="Coca-cola"),
    Customer(name="Alex", food="popcorn")
]
cleaning_staff = Cleaner(name="Anna")

hall.movie_session(movie_name=movie_name, customers=customers, cleaning_staff=cleaning_staff)
```

2. In directory `app` create package `people`. In this package
   create modules:
   - `customer.py` - inside this module create `Customer` class,
   its `__init__` method takes and stores `name`, `food` - food that 
   customer wants to buy in cinema bar. 
   This class should have only one method `watch_movie`, this 
   method takes `movie` and prints what movie customer is watching.
   
   ```python
   bob = Customer(name="Bob", food="popcorn")
   bob.watch_movie(movie="Madagascar")
   # Bob is watching "Madagascar".
   ```
   
   - `cinema_staff.py` - inside this module create `Cleaner` class,
   its `__init__` method takes and stores `name`. 
   This class should have only one method `clean_hall`, this method
   takes `hall_number` - number of hall that cleaner have to clean and
   prints that cleaner is cleaning that hall.

   ```python
   anna = Cleaner(name="Anna")
   anna.clean_hall(hall_number=5)
   # Cleaner Anna is cleaning hall number 5.
   ```

In the module `main.py` you have to import all this classes. Classes
should be imported by absolute path, that starts with 'app.' with 
keyword 'from'. Write a
function `cinema_visit` that takes `movie`, `customers` - a list 
of customers, elements are dicts with 'name' and desired 'food' of a 
customer, `hall_number` - number of the hall in cinema, 
`cleaner` - name of the cleaner, that will clean the
hall after movie session.

This function should create instances of `Customer`, `CinemaHall`, and `Cleaner`.
First, the cinema bar should sell food to customers. To do this, you can use the `CinemaBar`
class without creating an instance. Then, the cinema hall should schedule a movie session,
and finally, a cleaner should clean the cinema hall.  We expect each class to work with the provided data,
accepting parameters in the correct order and having the necessary methods.
No additional checks or error handling are needed!

Example (do not add it to `main.py`): 
```python
customers = [
    {"name": "Bob", "food": "Coca-cola"},
    {"name": "Alex", "food": "popcorn"}
]
hall_number = 5
cleaner_name = "Anna"
movie = "Madagascar"
cinema_visit(customers=customers, hall_number=hall_number, cleaner=cleaner_name, movie=movie)
# Cinema bar sold Coca-cola to Bob.
# Cinema bar sold popcorn to Alex.
# "Madagascar" started in hall number 5.
# Bob is watching "Madagascar".
# Alex is watching "Madagascar".
# "Madagascar" ended.
# Cleaner Anna is cleaning hall number 5.
```

**Important Note**: Each method responsible for performing a task should only print a message using
the `print()` function. There is no need to return anything or use the `logging` module.

Finally, check your code using this [checklist](checklist.md) before pushing your solution.
